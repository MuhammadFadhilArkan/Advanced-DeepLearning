It has 3 state variables: $a$, $b$ and $c$. The computation returned is $ax^2 + bx + c$. Make sure it can also accept an activation function.\n","\n","#### `__init__`\n","- call `super(my_fun, self)` to access the base class of `my_fun`, and call the `__init__()` function to initialize that base class.  In this case, `my_fun` is `SimpleQuadratic` and its base class is `Layer`.\n","- self.units: set this using one of the function parameters.\n","- self.activation: The function parameter `activation` will be passed in as a string.  To get the tensorflow object associated with the string, please use `tf.keras.activations.get()` \n","\n","\n","#### `build`\n","The following are suggested steps for writing your code.  If you prefer to use fewer lines to implement it, feel free to do so.  Either way, you'll want to set `self.a`, `self.b` and `self.c`.\n","\n","- a_init: set this to tensorflow's `random_normal_initializer()`\n","- a_init_val: Use the `random_normal_initializer()` that you just created and invoke it, setting the `shape` and `dtype`.\n","    - The `shape` of `a` should have its row dimension equal to the last dimension of `input_shape`, and its column dimension equal to the number of units in the layer.  \n","    - This is because you'll be matrix multiplying x^2 * a, so the dimensions should be compatible.\n","    - set the dtype to 'float32'\n","- self.a: create a tensor using tf.Variable, setting the initial_value and set trainable to True.\n","\n","- b_init, b_init_val, and self.b: these will be set in the same way that you implemented a_init, a_init_val and self.a\n","- c_init: set this to `tf.zeros_initializer`.\n","- c_init_val: Set this by calling the tf.zeros_initializer that you just instantiated, and set the `shape` and `dtype`\n","  - shape: This will be a vector equal to the number of units.  This expects a tuple, and remember that a tuple `(9,)` includes a comma.\n","  - dtype: set to 'float32'.\n","- self.c: create a tensor using tf.Variable, and set the parameters `initial_value` and `trainable`.\n","\n","#### `call`\n","The following section performs the multiplication x^2*a + x*b + c.  The steps are broken down for clarity, but you can also perform this calculation in fewer lines if you prefer.\n","- x_squared: use tf.math.square()\n","- x_squared_times_a: use tf.matmul().  \n","  - If you see an error saying `InvalidArgumentError: Matrix size-incompatible`, please check the order of the matrix multiplication to make sure that the matrix dimensions line up.\n","- x_times_b: use tf.matmul().\n","- x2a_plus_xb_plus_c: add the three terms together.\n","- activated_x2a_plus_xb_plus_c: apply the class's `activation` to the sum of the three terms.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hOzPkkajVJCE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633854904307,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Fadhil Arkan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"04721188090415610949"}}},"source":["class SimpleQuadratic(Layer):\n","\n","    def __init__(self, units=32, activation=None):\n","        '''Initializes the class and sets up the internal variables'''\n","        # YOUR CODE HERE \n","        super(SimpleQuadratic, self).__init__() \n","        self.units = units \n","        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation) \n","    \n","    def build(self, input_shape):\n","        '''Create the state of the layer (weights)'''\n","        # a and b should be initialized with random normal, c (or the bias) with zeros.\n","        # remember to set these as trainable.\n","        # YOUR CODE HERE\n","        \n","        a_init = tf.random_normal_initializer() \n","        self.a = tf.Variable(name = 'a', initial_value = a_init(shape = (input_shape[-1], self.units), dtype = 'float32'), trainable = True) \n","        \n","        b_init = tf.random_normal_initializer() \n","        self.b = tf.Variable(name = 'b', initial_value = b_init(shape = (input_shape[-1], self.units), dtype = 'float32'), trainable = True) \n","        \n","        c_init = tf.zeros_initializer()  \n","        self.c = tf.Variable(name = 'bias', initial_value = c_init(shape = (self.units,), dtype = 'float32'),trainable = True)\n","        \n","        #super().build(input_shape) \n","        \n","    def call(self, inputs):\n","        '''Defines the computation from inputs to outputs'''\n","        # YOUR CODE HERE \n","        return self.activation(tf.matmul(tf.math.square(inputs), self.a) +  tf.matmul(inputs, self.b) + self.c)"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nkmJAb0jVI9X","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633854938092,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":33793,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Fadhil Arkan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"04721188090415610949"}},"outputId":"bed5e430-6db5-4462-ab18-7112f545c64e"},"source":["mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist\n","\n","(x_train, y_train),(x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()\n","x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0\n","\n","model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([\n","  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),\n","  SimpleQuadratic(128, activation='relu'),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n","])\n","\n","model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n","              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',\n","              metrics=['accuracy'])\n","\n","model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)\n","model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Downloading data from https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz\n","11493376/11490434 [==============================] - 0s 0us/step\n","11501568/11490434 [==============================] - 0s 0us/step\n","Epoch 1/5\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 7s 3ms/step - loss: 0.2706 - accuracy: 0.9198\n","Epoch 2/5\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 6s 3ms/step - loss: 0.1324 - accuracy: 0.9599\n","Epoch 3/5\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 6s 3ms/step - loss: 0.1020 - accuracy: 0.9698\n","Epoch 4/5\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 6s 3ms/step - loss: 0.0835 - accuracy: 0.9739\n","Epoch 5/5\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 6s 3ms/step - loss: 0.0723 - accuracy: 0.9771\n","313/313 [==============================] - 1s 2ms/step - loss: 0.0704 - accuracy: 0.9787\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[0.07035569846630096, 0.9786999821662903]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]}]}
